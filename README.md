## 🙍🏻‍♂️ About Me

Hello, I'm Mohammad Tanvir Chowdhury, and I am a passionate full-stack developer with expertise in building scalable and high-performance web applications using modern technologies such as JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Node.js, and MongoDB. My strong foundation in front-end and back-end development, paired with experience in designing RESTful APIs, ensures seamless integration and optimal user experiences.

With a sharp focus on clean code, maintainability, and continuous learning, I love working in dynamic environments and enjoy solving complex problems. I am driven by innovation and collaboration, consistently seeking to improve processes and deliver exceptional results that align with business goals.

As a Front-End Developer Intern at View AI from December 2023 to June 2024, I designed and developed the company’s landing page, creating an engaging first touchpoint for visitors. I also implemented an interactive dashboard that allowed users to upload CSV files, transforming raw data into insightful visual graphs for better decision-making. My focus on enhancing the user experience contributed to improved navigation and overall satisfaction, aligning with View AI’s mission to empower enterprises with AI-driven solutions.

I have completed three comprehensive courses, including advanced training in React.js and Next.js through the Reactive Accelerator, full-stack web development with Programming Hero, and a deep dive into computer science fundamentals with Phitron. These courses have equipped me with expertise in front-end and back-end technologies, state management, server-side rendering, and problem-solving through algorithms and data structures.
